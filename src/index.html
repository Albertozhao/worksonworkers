        Does Workers supports React/Angular/Svelte/your frontend framework of choice?
      </h3>

      <p class="text-lg py-4">
        Workers supports some server-rendered solutions for frameworks like React and Svelte. We
        generally suggest
        these solutions for power-users, and recommend that developers deploying front-end applications check out our
        deployment platform Cloudflare Pages.
      </p>

        A package that you suggested doesn't work!
      </h3>

      <p class="text-lg py-4">
        Some packages may require special configuration (see the "Notes" section for each package). If a package is
        listed on our list that isn't supported, you can reach out to us on the <a class="underline"
          href="https://discord.gg/cloudflaredev">Cloudflare Workers Discord server</a> and we'll get
        it removed as soon as possible.

        What packages don't work?
      </h3>

      <p class="text-lg py-4">
        Many packages that require <em>Node dependencies</em>, such as <code>fs</code> or <code>net/http</code>, aren't
        supported in Workers because Workers isn't Node—it's <a class="underline"
          href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works">built on V8</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg">
        If you're using browser packages in Workers, you should be aware that many of them refer to
        <code>window</code>—the instance of the browser window. This isn't supported in Workers (because it runs in V8,
        not on a browser window).
